# Pathfinding Algorithm Visualization

This project visualizes several classical pathfinding algorithms on a 2D grid using Python and `matplotlib`. Users can interactively select algorithms to explore how they find paths from a start to a goal position, avoiding obstacles.

## **Features**

- Visualizes the following algorithms:
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
  - Depth-First Search (DFS)
  - Uniform Cost Search (UCS)
  - Depth-Limited Search (DLS)
  - Iterative Deepening Depth-First Search (IDDFS)
  - Bidirectional Search
- Obstacles (walls) are represented in the grid.
- Real-time visualization with color-coded states:
  - Start and Goal
  - Visited nodes
  - Frontier nodes
  - Final Path
